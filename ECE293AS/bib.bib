	abstract="An overview is given of the class of subspace techniques (STs) for identifying linear, time-invariant state-space models from input-output data. STs do not require a parametrization of the system matrices and as a consequence do not suffer from problems related to local minima that often hamper successful application of parametric optimization- based identification methods.",

	abstract = {Data-driven discovery is revolutionizing the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems. This textbook brings together machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to integrate modeling and control of dynamical systems with modern methods in data science. It highlights many of the recent advances in scientific computing that enable data-driven methods to be applied to a diverse range of complex systems, such as turbulence, the brain, climate, epidemiology, finance, robotics, and autonomy. Aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in the engineering and physical sciences, the text presents a range of topics and methods from introductory to state of the art.}
